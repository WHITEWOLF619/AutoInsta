# AutoInsta

A bot to follow and unfollow people based on the profiles you mention. 


follow - unfollow is an old tactic people use to increase their engagement. You can select the pages whoes followers you want to send follow request (the audience you want to sell  your product). 
by use of selenium and web automation you can automate the task of following people and unfollowing people. 

This program has an algorithm that tries to evade instagram detection by using time delay and skipping profilies.(took me a lot of time to figure out)

Dont follow/unfollow more than 200 people in 24 hrs.(Instagram will ban you!!!).
